# DMCS-project-2-Jason-s-webshare-welcome-page
This is a project PRACTICE. I learn by doing, so here is what I will do:
I will use the welcome page in the web share I am sharing with my technical coach Jason as a model, a benchmark to work myself up to it. Right now the welcome page of the Jason webshare has HTML tags that I don't yet know how to use but having that project will help me plot a path through HTML. I see my own project being a lot simpler than this page, but as I say, this is just a possible aiming standard.
